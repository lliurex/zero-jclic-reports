jclic for Debian
----------------
Please note that JClic needs Sun Java.

In that case you might get ugly errors at starting JClic if you have
another Java runtime engine than the Sun JVM set as your default Java
virtual machine. This can easily be changed by running

	# update-alternatives --config java

as root and explicitly choosing Sun Java there.



On the other hand, even if the sources include them, this package does not include jclic applet 
and reports web application. They are not compiled neither signed to be used
in a web environment.
